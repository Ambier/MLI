title: MLI Overview
---

MLI is a project from the [AMP Lab](http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu) that is a component of [MLbase](http://mlbase.org). MLI provides a developer-friendly API for distributed machine learning. The current system supports Spark as a backend runtime for this API, but we may introduce others in the future. The goal of MLI is to ease and accelerate the development of distributed algorithms for machine learning.
